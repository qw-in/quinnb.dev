# Quinn Blenkinsop

*My application for the <ExternalLink url="https://tailwindcss.com/careers/staff-software-engineer">tailwindcss Staff Software Engineer position</ExternalLink>*

Hi! I'm Quinn, a full-stack developer based in Vancouver, British Columbia. Passionate about the web, developer tools, and pushing to improve experiences for developers and users alike.

I was laid off two weeks ago (more on that later), and I decided to take a strict two weeks off to de-stress and reset. Fun personal projects only! So, I've put this together a little quickly (<ExternalLink url="https://github.com/qw-in/quinnb.dev/commits/main/src/pages/secret-tailwindcss-application-shhh.mdx">perhaps with a few post-deadline updates</ExternalLink>  😉).

## The hard pitch ⚾️

I'm a solid full-stack developer with wide-ranging experience in the ecosystem. Passionate about the web, developer tools, and not satisfied with the status quo. Excited to learn new things, with a track record of picking up new technologies quickly and sharing what I've discovered with those around me. I have years of experience communicating with clients and working in or leading small teams. Always working to improve processes and deliver a product I'm proud of within the constraints.

> Build and document new features

This has been my day-to-day for the best part of the last decade, building features large and small. Agonizing over directory structure, variable naming, and asking "Does this comment add helpful context?". Writing technical documentation for project handoff, internal knowledge bases, and more `README.md`s than I care to count. Designing the architecture, APIs, and code patterns for new features. Introducing and leading team kickoff meetings to prioritize, plan, and distribute work.

> Contribute improvements to upstream projects

I'd love to have a chance to do more of this! My previous employers have not generally been open to external contributions on company time, but I've always opened issues or made small contributions where I can. Sometimes on my own time, when interest or annoyance strikes, for example <ExternalLink url="https://github.com/snakemake/snakemake/pull/2105">snakemake</ExternalLink>, <ExternalLink url="https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/pull/2556" >graphiql</ExternalLink>, and <ExternalLink url="https://github.com/carbon-app/carbon/pull/1069">carbon</ExternalLink> pull requests. It took some convincing, but <ExternalLink url="https://satelcreative.com/">satelcreative</ExternalLink> let me open-source a few libraries and tools over the years as well such as <ExternalLink url="https://github.com/SatelCreative/crisp">Crisp</ExternalLink>, <ExternalLink url="https://github.com/SatelCreative/formik-polaris">formik-polaris</ExternalLink>, and <ExternalLink url="https://github.com/SatelCreative/spylib">spylib</ExternalLink>.

> Maintain CI workflows

Just a couple of months ago at <ExternalLink url="https://www.linkedin.com/company/beaker-bio/">Beaker</ExternalLink>, I built a GitHub action to automate testing and building an electron app. The workflow included cross-platform builds (please give us `arch` for macOS runners GitHub), code signing, and auto-update integration.

Previously, at <ExternalLink url="https://satelcreative.com/">satel</ExternalLink>, <ExternalLink url="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthony-hillairet/">Ant</ExternalLink> and I advocated for and then maintained a Jenkins CI server with on-prem runners. We used that for many years across many projects and clients.

> Manage issues and contributions

I have lots of experience managing private projects, sometimes with external collaborators, but a large open-source project would be a new challenge. I've worked hard over the years on my communication authoring issues and during code review. Always trying to meet people where they are. Finding the balance between being helpful and being pedantic. Trusting contributions are made in good faith, and genuinely trying to understand the author's perspective. When I do give feedback, I try to give context, provide the resources I'm pulling from, or share a relevant story of how maybe I've been burned by this in the past.

Internally at <ExternalLink url="https://satelcreative.com/">Satel</ExternalLink>, I worked hard with the team to both implement pull-request reviews and to make them a positive experience. We had a lot of success with this, and I'm proud of the culture we built around code review.
